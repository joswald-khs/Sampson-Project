My visualization shows the changes in indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity in different rooms of Sampson Hall over one week.
The bars represent temperature (yellow-indoor, blue-outdoor), and the lines represent humidity(green-indoor, orange-outdoor). The left Y axis represents temperature(Celsius). The right Y axis represents humidity(Percentage). And press the arrow keys to navigate, UP and DOWN switch rooms, LEFT and RIGHT switch dates.


I Learned how to load and read data in Processing, and use arrays to store and display different sets. Using double Y axis to display two independent data sets.

How to align all data when switching rooms or dates. How to make the gumidity curve update better when switching dates or rooms.

I will add the weekly average temperature or humidty measurement. I will change the visualization colors to make it easier to read.
