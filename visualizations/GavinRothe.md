My graph is a temperature over time line graph which displays all three locations being observed and the outside temperature to observe differences between them. 

- Sections which are night time will be marked by their coding a vertical section of the screen to be slightly darker at a certain time, or by making the screen get darker when the pattern in the data is decreasing.
- On the y-axis is temperature in whichever unit, fahrenheit or celsius.
- On the x-axis is time in days of data collected.
- Each line will be a different color or weight to deistiguish between them
- Lines will be made by connecting each point of each data set with a straight line, not curved.

The user of my data will interact with the data by being able to input various data sets and have them shown at the same time. Also maybe I can find a way so when you hover over the line with the cursor you can see the exact temperature and time it is at.
