# Ainara's visualization

My visualization shows the temperature and humidity of different stations through time. Time is the x axis, temperature is the y, the circle size represents humidity, and each station has an assigned color. Working on my visualization y learned how to use different color modes and add text, while practicing using coordinates to draw my data.

If I worked on improving it, I would make it possible to work with flexible time ranges, select stations and work with averages. I was able to figure out what I needed to do it, but to improve it there is some more for me to learn.
