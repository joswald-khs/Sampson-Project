# APCSA Ideas Document

## APCSA Initial Session Notes

We will be creating data visualizations in Processing using data that we collect from stations inside Sampson, as well as external data such as outside weather and climate control systems.

### Questions
* Where will the data be?
  * In the cloud... somewhere TBD
* Will the data be **live** or **archived**?
  * It will be both
  * Archived data will be accessible 
* How many stations will there be?
  * Initially three stations
  * Designs should be able to work for all _potential_ stations
* At what interval will the data be collected?

### Data to collect

* **Station Data**
  * temp
  * humidity
  * timestamp
  * location
* **Outside weather**
  * temp
  * humidity
  * precipitation
  * cloud cover
  * wind
* **Climate control**
  * thermostat settings
    * rooms
    * floors
    * building
   
### Other needs 
* A map of Sampson
* Characteristics of the locations
  * size
  * number of occupants
  * which way the room faces
  * floor

## What questions should we try to answer?

## What visualizations might we use
_include a screenshot of an example visualization, or draw your own, along with a description of the data to be displayed, and the question(s) you hope to answer with this visualization_
