I plan to use a line chart to show the relationship between heat and humidity. The chart will have two lines, one for heat and one for humidity, and Iâ€™ll use two y axes to represent their different measurement scales. The x-axis will display the room numbers, as all measurements were taken simultaneously. The users can interact with it by hovering over the line, and it will show the temperature or humidity on it.
