My graph is a temperature over time line graph which displays all three locations being observed and the outside temperature to observe differences between them. 

- Sections which are night time will be marked by their coding a vertical section of the screen to be slightly darker at a certain time, or by making the screen get darker when the pattern in the data is decreasing.
- On the y-axis is temperature in whichever unit, fahrenheit or celsius.
- On the x-axis is time in days of data collected.
- Each line will be a different color or weight to deistiguish between them
- Lines will be made by connecting each point of each data set with a straight line, not curved.

The user will be able to interact with my sketch by being able to represent multiple data sets at the same time to best compare them. Also I might try to make it so when the user hovers over the line with their cursor it will display the temperature and time of that point.
